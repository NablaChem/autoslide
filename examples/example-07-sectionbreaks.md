### Dealing with uncertainty

We learn: $f(\mathbf{x})$

---

Uncertainty in label value ($f$)
- Measurement accuracy
- Variation in population

| Individual | Duck speed |
|----|----|
| Donald | 1 km/h |
| Dagobert | 3 km/h |
| Track | 2 km/h |


-|-

Uncertainty in features ($\mathbf{x}$)
- Incompleteness of observation
- Accuracy of features

| Environment | Duck speed |
|----|----|
| Water | 3 km/h |
| Land | 3 km/h |
| Air | 54 km/h |

- noise increases regularization strength $\lambda$
- defines the limit of learning
